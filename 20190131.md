Thursday, January 31, 2019 HeatSync Labs 108 W Main Â· Mesa, AZ

Welcome back Desert Rustaceans. This month join us at HeatSync Labs for Rust and Games.

Whether you're a Rust pro or just looking for a project to learn on, come show off what you've all been working on and thinking about over winter break.

I know there are folks in our community already making Text Adventures, Roguelikes, Web assembled stuff and even physical games on a microcontrollers so well have plenty to talk about.

Come [re]connect with your local Rust peers, find out that there is more Rust in the valley than you thought.

Also, join us on slack at #rust on https://azwebdevs.org
