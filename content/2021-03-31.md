# Rust Search Extension via [@PeterKehl](https://github.com/peter-kehl)

Peter shared a helpful browser plugin called [Rust Search Extension](https://rust.extension.sh/). It allows you to search docs, crates, builtin attributes, official books, and error codes from the address bar of your browser. Very handy!
