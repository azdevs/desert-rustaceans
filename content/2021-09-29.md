# Visitors from Vancouver Rust via [@JonathanLouie](https://github.com/jonathanrlouie) and [@WangXiaoying](https://github.com/wangxiaoying)

Repo: [https://github.com/vancouver-rs/talks](https://github.com/vancouver-rs/talks)

We were joined by two members of the [Vancouver Rust Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Rust). [Wang Xiaoying](https://github.com/wangxiaoying) is PhD student using Rust in an academic project, [ConnectorX](https://github.com/sfu-db/connector-x), a Python package that enables you to load data from databases into Python in the fastest and most memory efficient way. [Jonathan Louie](https://github.com/jonathanrlouie) dabbles with many languages like Scala and [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/) has some interesting game projects written in Rust like [a Wii Play Tanks clone](https://github.com/jonathanrlouie/tanks) made with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

# Conversation around [Steve Klabnik's "I Refuse to Let Amazon Define Rust" Tweet](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/1437441118745071617)

We talked about [Steve Klabnik's tweet](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/1437441118745071617) responding to [an article by Matt Asay](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3633002/the-future-of-rust.html) which suggested that Rust's principles were modeled after Amazon's leadership principles.

Originally Rust was developed by a single person, [Graydon Hoare](https://github.com/graydon). It expanded to [a team of developers](https://github.com/rust-lang/team). Now it is community-run and has a foundation. That's a good thing. Do we really want a [TC39 committee](https://tc39.es/) controlled by FAANG companies to hand things down to us? The point of the Rust foundation should be to cycle in new blood.

We also talked about [Rust's async roadmap](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async-foundations/vision/roadmap.html), specifically about how [Generic Associated Types (GATs)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1598-generic_associated_types.md) are [coming soon to Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/generic-associated-types-initiative).

# Rant on (the lack of) Overloading via [@NathanBrown](https://github.com/ngbrown)

Repo: [https://github.com/ngbrown/rust-in-action](https://github.com/ngbrown/rust-in-action)

Nathan is working through the projects in the [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action) book by Tim McNamara. In the [Chapter 3 project](https://github.com/ngbrown/rust-in-action/tree/master/ch3-not-quite-file), he has a `File` struct containing `name` and `data` fields. Sometimes he wants to create a `File` with only a `name` (`data` is empty). Sometimes, he wants to create a `File` with both `name` and `data`. He wishes that he could overload the `new()` method; that way he wouldn't have to think about the name of the method, just its parameters. However, this is not possible in Rust. The best he could do was have [an enum enumerating the possible parameter combinations](https://github.com/ngbrown/rust-in-action/compare/88d0a060...866c06dd#diff-99615b9c1723d1818911ecb89a2ee4d07e6248defffeaea663894534e2b8fd7eR14-R17) and use the [From<T>](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html) to convert the tuples passed in into the appropriate enum type. There is [a StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67064869/25182) that describes how to do this.

Jacob mentioned the [builder pattern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/ownership/builders.html) as Rust's way of constructing complex data structures. With the builder pattern, you make a struct to hold all the intermediates and then a final build step that checks that you have everything you need before making the final struct. So rather than overloading, we could have something like:

```
File::new()
  .withData()
  .returnsTheThing()
```

You can use macros to hide the complexity behind an abstraction. However, macros are a crutch and generally only make problems worse. [Blaine ranted about macros before](https://azdevs.github.io/desert-rustaceans/2020-09-30/), and in fact that conversation proceeded the same way: builder pattern ➡ macros ➡ Blaine rants about macros.

# Language Negotiation via [@JesusGuzmanJr](https://github.com/JesusGuzmanJr)

Jesus was working on adding [Language Negotiation](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-when-lang-neg) to his Rocket web server using the [unic-langid](https://crates.io/crates/unic-langid) crate. It has [a very straight-forward API](https://docs.rs/unic-langid/0.9.0/unic_langid/) and he enjoyed working with it.
