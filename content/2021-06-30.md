# Revamping Rust Training Materials via [@jacobrosenthal](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal)

Repo: [https://jacobrosenthal.github.io/rust-training-aimldevfest-2019](https://jacobrosenthal.github.io/rust-training-aimldevfest-2019)

Jacob revamped a lot of his [Rust training book](https://jacobrosenthal.github.io/rust-training-aimldevfest-2019) which introduces Rust and basic image processing (convolution for edge detection, sharpening, blurring, etc). If you read it, please share any feedback with Jacob!

# Github1s and Octotree via [@PeterKehl](https://github.com/peter-kehl)

Peter shared [github1s](https://github.com/conwnet/github1s) a site that opens GitHub repos in VSCode. There is also a Chrome extension, [Github1s Extension](https://github.com/Darkempire78/Github1s-Extension/) that injects a button on the GitHub site to do the same.

Peter also shared [Octotree](https://www.octotree.io/download), a Browser extension that enhances GitHub code review and exploration.
