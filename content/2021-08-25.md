# Reactive Rocket on AWS Lambda via [@mysteriouspants](https://github.com/mysteriouspants)

Repo: [https://github.com/mysteriouspants/rocket-on-lambdas-starter-template](https://github.com/mysteriouspants/rocket-on-lambdas-starter-template)

Blog Post: [https://www.mysteriouspants.com/2021/07/21/reactive-rocket-on-lambda.html](https://www.mysteriouspants.com/2021/07/21/reactive-rocket-on-lambda.html)

Chris showed everyone how to write a lambda in Rust and deploy it to AWS. He wrote [an excellent blog post](https://www.mysteriouspants.com/2021/07/21/reactive-rocket-on-lambda.html) describing the process in detail. The project uses the [AWS Lambda Runtime](https://crates.io/crates/lambda_runtime) and the [lambda-web crate](https://crates.io/crates/lambda-web), which adapts requests from API Gateway V2 passed through the Lambda runtime to Rocket. Actix and Warp are also supported Rust web frameworks.

# Async Bluetooth on the BBC micro:bit Microcontroller via [@jacobrosenthal](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal)

Repo: [https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/microbitv2-rs](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/microbitv2-rs)

Jacob wrote an example async Bluetooth LE program for the [BBC micro:bit microcontroller](https://microbit.org/).

The project makes use of the following crates:

- [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) for using async / await in an embedded no-std context
- [probe-run](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs) for flashing the program to the microcontroller
- [probe-rs](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs) for displaying logs from the microcontroller's onboard debugger.
- [flip-link](https://crates.io/crates/flip-link) which protects against [overflowing the stack region of data](https://github.com/knurling-rs/flip-link#the-problem) into the `.bss + .data` region by [putting the stack region below](https://github.com/knurling-rs/flip-link#the-solution) the `.bss + .data` memory region.

The program allows us to read and write data to a dummy [BLE characteristic](http://www.blesstags.eu/2018/08/services-characteristics-descriptors.html), which we did using the nRF Connect app (available for [Desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-connect-for-desktop), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en_US&gl=US), and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect-for-mobile/id1054362403)).
