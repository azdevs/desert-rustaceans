# Binary Serialization via [@jacobrosenthal](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal)

Im trying to simplify uploading code to the [pygamer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242). Theres an existing [uf2 converter](https://crates.io/crates/uf2) and you can just manually copy the file to the disk, but its kind of a lot of lines of setup and libraries we need installed. Honestly it works fine, I just like the idea of learning some more about Rust while cleaning up the workflow. This is the current state of things

```bash
#only needed one time
cargo install --git https://github.com/sajattack/uf2conv-rs
cargo install cargo-binutils
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
#each compile, objcopy actually already calls cargo under the hood here saving 1 line
cargo objcopy --example ferris_img --release -- -O binary ferris_img.bin
uf2conv-rs ferris_img.bin --base 0x4000 --output ferris_img.uf2
cp ferris_img.uf2 /Volumes/PYGAMERBOOT/
```

But its a lot of dependencies. Instead talking to the device over the HID protocol using the microsoft bootloader protocol called [hf2](https://github.com/microsoft/uf2/blob/master/hf2.md) which adafruit uses heavily. My work is at [uf2-rs](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/uf2-rs) where I use live upload over usb instead of a copy

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/uf2
cargo install cargo-binutils
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo objcopy --example ferris_img --release -- -O binary ferris_img.bin
uf2 flash -f ferris.bin 0x4000
```

My next step not yet done yet is to turn it into a cargo command using [cargo-project](https://github.com/japaric/cargo-project) reducing it into something like:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/uf2
cargo install cargo-binutils
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo uf2 --example ferris_img --release 0x4000
```

Ideally I can figure out how to convert the cargo elf file to a bin internally and remove the need for even llvm dependencies

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/uf2
cargo uf2 --example ferris_img --release 0x4000
```

The big thing this library needs to solve is how binary serialization to turn this c style struct

```rust
pub(crate) struct Command {
    ///Command ID
    id: u32,
    ///arbitrary number set by the host, for example as sequence number. The response should repeat the tag.
    tag: u16,
    ///reserved bytes in the command should be sent as zero and ignored by the device
    _reserved0: u8,
    ///reserved bytes in the command should be sent as zero and ignored by the device
    _reserved1: u8,
}
```

into a buffer to send over the wire. In std rust you might use the std [cursor](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Cursor.html) and The core available [from_le_bytes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i32.html#method.from_le_bytes) to help us turn bytes into primitives, and not mess up indexing, but but I like to write no_std code so I use a library called [scroll](https://github.com/m4b/scroll) like this

```rust
    //Packets are up to 64 bytes long
    let buffer = &mut [0_u8; 64];

    let mut offset = 1;

    buffer.gwrite_with(cmd.id, &mut offset, LE)?;
    buffer.gwrite_with(cmd.tag, &mut offset, LE)?;
    buffer.gwrite_with(cmd._reserved0, &mut offset, LE)?;
    buffer.gwrite_with(cmd._reserved1, &mut offset, LE)?;

```

# Other topics discussed:

## Using +nightly

For those not in the know say someone says you need the nightly build of a cargo crate. So you have to `rustup default nightly` first then `cargo install blah-thing` and then `rustup default stable` Instead you can add `+nightly` onto most commands to do something in nightly for just one command so all that becomes `cargo +nightly install blah-thing`

## [cargo-asm](https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm) to see what assembly language is generated

`cargo new helloworld && cd helloworld`

```bash
$ cargo asm helloworld::main --rust
 fn main() {
 push    rbp
 mov     rbp, rsp
 sub     rsp, 48
     lea     rax, [rip, +, l___unnamed_2]
     mov     qword, ptr, [rbp, -, 48], rax
     mov     qword, ptr, [rbp, -, 40], 1
     mov     qword, ptr, [rbp, -, 32], 0
     lea     rax, [rip, +, l___unnamed_3]
     mov     qword, ptr, [rbp, -, 16], rax
     mov     qword, ptr, [rbp, -, 8], 0
     lea     rdi, [rbp, -, 48]
 println!("Hello, world!");
 call    std::io::stdio::_print
 }
 add     rsp, 48
 pop     rbp
 ret
```

## [cargo-expand](https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-expand) to expand macros to the console so you can see what you're generating.

You may have seen by now you can implement Debug on a type for free if underlying types support it by using the `#[derive(Debug)]` attribute macro. Using cargo expand we can see what that did for us:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct S;

fn main() {
}
```

```rust
#![feature(prelude_import)]
#![no_std]
#[prelude_import]
use ::std::prelude::v1::*;
#[macro_use]
extern crate std as std;
struct S;
#[automatically_derived]
#[allow(unused_qualifications)]
impl ::core::fmt::Debug for S {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut ::core::fmt::Formatter) -> ::core::fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            S => {
                let mut debug_trait_builder = f.debug_tuple("S");
                debug_trait_builder.finish()
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() { }
```

## [cargo clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) for more help after it compiles

The compiler makes sure things compile, clippy tries to tell you there might be a better way to do things. You can replace 'check' in your ide with 'clippy' or run it on the command line.

```bash
$ cargo clippy
warning: casting u32 to f64 may become silently lossy if you later change the type
   --> src/bin.rs:166:51
    |
166 |     let padded_num_pages = (binary.len() as f64 / bininfo.flash_page_size as f64).ceil() as u32;
    |                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: try: `f64::from(bininfo.flash_page_size)`
    |
    = note: `#[warn(clippy::cast_lossless)]` on by default
    = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#cast_lossless

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 12.93s
$
```

Note you have it installed on nightly, it can also apply the suggestion automatically.

```bash
$ cargo +nightly fix -Z unstable-options --clippy
$ cargo clippy
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.57s
$
```

There is [a list of ALL the Clippy Lints](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/) which shows you all the rules in one place.

        .arg(
            Arg::with_name("number")
                .help("a number after which the next prime will occur")
                .index(1)
                .required(true),
        )
        .get_matches();

### Return Values

- Forgot the return type (`-> u64`)

- I was trying to return using a statement: `n;` vs an expression: `n`

> Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. Expressions evaluate to a resulting value.

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:4:26
  |
4 | fn next_prime(x: u64) -> u64 {
  |    ----------            ^^^ expected u64, found ()
  |    |
  |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression
...
7 |     n;
  |      - help: consider removing this semicolon
  |
  = note: expected type `u64`
             found type `()`
```
