# Discord Bots via [@mysteriouspants](https://github.com/mysteriouspants)

Chris shared his Discord bot which discourages people from talking politics outside the _#politics_ channel (indeed a noble cause). He used [Serenity](https://crates.io/crates/serenity) which is an opinionated Rust library for the Discord API. Chris didn't like some of the opinions (specifically that bot commands should start with a character like `!` or `~`) but luckily the framework had an escape method that runs on any message, so he used that to make [his own handler](https://github.com/mysteriouspants/mysteriousbot/blob/caba97f1d219076c28e45f61648e4675e3166a3b/src/mysterious_message_handler.rs).

One advantage of writing the project in Rust was that it made deploying the bot really simple. As Chris writes:

> "to deploy you just take the built binary, scp it somewhere, and run it. There's no grand dependency chain from the OS to worry about, even the TLS layer is handled internally thanks to RusTLS."

Chris posted an [in-depth article about it on his blog](https://www.mysteriouspants.com/blog/mysteriousbot-weekend-notes/), check it out!

# Digital Signal Processing via [@jacobrosenthal](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal)

Jacob has been working through the [Digital Signal Processing using Arm Cortex-M based Microcontrollers](https://www.arm.com/resources/education/books/dsptextbook) book. The book's examples and exercises are written in C, so Jacob made his implementation in Rust and compared it to the C code.

Digital Signal Processing is about trying to find the signal in the noise.

## Creating Signals with Iterators

We can think of a continuous signal as represented by discrete points occurring at a fixed time interval, and digitally as values in an array or Vec.

Writing things the C way, you have to be careful not to overflow the array. Using iterators in Rust, you don't have to worry about this class of error. As an example, a unit pulse (a spike at t=0 followed by a flat signal) could look like:

```
type N = heapless::consts::U10;

fn main() {
    let unit_pulse = (0..(N::to_usize())).map(|n| if n == 0 { 1.0 } else { 0.0 });
    display::<N, _>("unit_pulse", unit_pulse);
}
```

A sin wave could look like:

```
type N = heapless::consts::U10;
const W0: f32 = core::f32::consts::PI / 5.0;

fn main() {
    let sinusoidal = (0..(N::to_usize())).map(|n| (W0 * n as f32).sin());
    display::<N, _>("sinusoidal", sinusoidal);
}
```

Furthermore, it is easy to write clean code that combine these signals. For instance, for a delayed unit pulse, you can just take an iterator that produces 0's, use `take(K)` to take K values from it, and chain the `unit_pulse` iterator on that.

With this, you can create all sorts of filters (high pass, low pass, etc). You can create a window signal that lets you pick segments of a signal, you can negate the signal, etc.

## cmsis-dsp-sys Crate

Jacob has a [crate](https://crates.io/crates/cmsis-dsp-sys) which provides Rust bindings for the prebuilt cmsis-dsp math library. Here CMSIS stands for Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) which is a hardware abstraction layer for microcontrollers that are based on Arm Cortex processors.

## Graphing Libraries, Terminal User Interaces, and Cargo Embed

Jacob also showed off some fancy graphing libraries:

-   [textplots](https://crates.io/crates/textplots): A library for plotting graphs in terminal.

-   [plotly](https://crates.io/crates/plotly): A more sophisticated plotting libary which is powered by [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) (which is built on [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)).

-   [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs): A library for building rich terminal user interfaces and dashboards.

-   [cargo-embed](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-embed): A general purpose tool for embedded targets that can do flashing, logging RTT output from the target, opening a GDB server connected to the target and more.

## Magic Wand TensorFlow Lite Example for the PyGamer

As an alternative to writing your own algorithms to process signals, you can train a machine learning (ML) model to come up with the relevant rules for you. TensorFlow is a library that represents computations as a dataflow graph, which is widely used in ML. There is a scaled-down port of TensorFlow, called TFMicro, which can run on constrained systems like microcontrollers. A "magic wand" is a common demonstration of TFMicro which uses a model trained on the accelerometer data to infer how the device is being waved around (e.g. in a circular motion) and change the color of an LED based on the inferred motion.

As there is a [tfmicro crate](https://crates.io/crates/tfmicro) which provides no-std Rust bindings for the TFMicro library, Jacob created a [magic wand example](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/atsamd/blob/tfmicro/boards/pygamer/examples/magic_wand.rs) in the [atsamd pygamer](https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd/tree/master/boards/pygamer) project he works on which provides a board support crate for the [AdaFruit PyGamer board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242).

# Managing Game State via [@DanielPBank](https://github.com/danielbank)

I started working on a simple game to get some practical experience working with `structs`, `impl` blocks, and the ownership model. Some interesting topics came up around making games with Rust.

## ECS

The first recommendation was that I could look at common patterns that game developers use to inform my research. [Entity–component–system (ECS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) is an architectural pattern that is mostly used in game development. There is a game engine written in Rust called [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/) which comes with an ECS crate called [specs](https://crates.io/crates/specs). Chris also shared a [RustConf keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKLntZcp27M) by [Catherine West](https://github.com/kyren) where she shares good (and bad) practices for developing game engines in general, and how Rust helps guide you to those patterns.

As always, a good resource for any topic in Rust is the `Are We ____` site, in this case: https://www.arewegameyet.rs/
