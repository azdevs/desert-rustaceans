# Discord Bots via [@mysteriouspants](https://github.com/mysteriouspants)

Chris shared his Discord bot which discourages people from talking politics outside the _#politics_ channel (indeed a noble cause). He used [Serenity](https://crates.io/crates/serenity) which is an opinionated Rust library for the Discord API. Chris didn't like some of the opinions (specifically that bot commands should start with a character like `!` or `~`) but luckily the framework had an escape method that runs on any message, so he used that to make [his own handler](https://github.com/mysteriouspants/mysteriousbot/blob/caba97f1d219076c28e45f61648e4675e3166a3b/src/mysterious_message_handler.rs).

One advantage of writing the project in Rust was that it made deploying the bot really simple. As Chris writes:

> "to deploy you just take the built binary, scp it somewhere, and run it. There's no grand dependency chain from the OS to worry about, even the TLS layer is handled internally thanks to RusTLS."

Chris posted an [in-depth article about it on his blog](https://www.mysteriouspants.com/blog/mysteriousbot-weekend-notes/), check it out!

# Digital Signal Processing via [@jacobrosenthal](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal)

Jacob has been working through the [Digital Signal Processing using Arm Cortex-M based Microcontrollers](https://www.arm.com/resources/education/books/dsptextbook) book. The goal was to better understand translating C code to Rust, attempting to utilize functional paradigms, and exlore and fill in the math shortcomings in no_std embedded Rust. 

Ive got a nice setup https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/dsp-discoveryf4-rust/  where I'm building up the examples from the book in Rust and some nice patterns around graphing on command line, or in browser when necessary, as well as running them on an actual device and doing timing calculations to see how Rust fares.

## DSP

Digital Signal Processing is about trying to find the signal in the noise. THis is a very short crash course on signals and systems, mostly from the point of view of translating c code to a functional style.

## Signals
There are five fundamental discrete time signals, unit pulse, unit step, unit ramp, exponential, and sinusoidal. We can use these to make simulated streams of data to practice against as well as to build up filters we'll run against that data.

A unit pulse is 1 at 0, and 0 everywhere else. Writing things the C way, you have to be careful not to overflow the array.
```rust
let mut unit_pulse = [0f32; N];
for n in 0..N {
    if n == 0 {
        unit_pulse[n] = 1.0;
    } else {
        unit_pulse[n] = 0.0;
    }
}
```
In cases when we dont need random access to any previous elements we can do a litte more idiomatic rust by using an iter_mut over the existing buffer to keep us from accessing outside of our array.
```rust
let mut unit_pulse = [0f32; N];
unit_pulse.iter_mut().enumerate().for_each(|(n, val)| {
    if n == 0 {
        *val = 1.0;
    } else {
        *val = 0.0;
    }
});
```
An even more fully functional approach is available though. Well use a range, and `map` each of those values.
```rust
type N = heapless::consts::U10;
let unit_pulse_iter = (0..(N::to_usize())).map(|n| if n == 0 { 1.0 } else { 0.0 });
```
Theres obviously quite a bit of visual 'noise' now with the length encoded as a type, and the turbofish in the collect. Luckily we can go back to arrays and remove the turbofish shortly when const generics are merged.

Note iterators are lazy and have to be consumed. Our iterator is thus is a rather small data strucutre thats very cheap to clone, which means iterators are very memory efficient on top of their safety. In no_std rust we dont have Vec, but there is a library called Heapless that has a vec type. When it comes time to fetch all those values, well need to use that instead of array using `collect`
```rust
let unit_pulse = unit_pulse_iter.collect::<heapless::Vec<f32>>();
```

Another fundamental is a unit step. Its just 1 everywhere.
```rust
let unit_step = core::iter::repeat(1.0).take(N::to_usize());
```

We can combine fundamental signals to make discrete time systems. In this case we subtract two unit steps to create a window filter.
```rust
let window = core::iter::repeat(0.0)
    .take(4)
    .chain(unit_step.clone())
    .take(N::to_usize())
    .zip(unit_step.clone())
    .map(|(us_delay, us)| us - us_delay);
```
We saw a bunch of new stuff.

* A core function called `repeat` lets us get an infinity iterator of a primitive, in this case 0.
* Then we can `take` 4 of those zeros.
* We can then `chain` our unit step at the end of those 4 zeros, effectively delaying our unit step by 4.
* Then we can `zip` that delayed unit step signal with another unit step signal so we get one of each of them at a time. 
* Finally we use `map` to subtract the delayed unit step from the naked unit step.

The result is 4 1s and the rest zeros.
```bash
"window": 1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000

A digression. An exponential signal looks like
```rust
let exponential = (0..(N::to_usize())).map(|val| A.powf(val as f32));
```
```bash
"exponential": 1.0000, 0.8000, 0.6400, 0.5120, 0.4096, 0.3277, 0.2621, 0.2097, 0.1678, 0.1342

⠂                             ⡀                              
⡁                                   ⡀                        
⠄                                         ⡀                  
⠂                                               ⠄            
⠁                                                     ⠁       0.1
0.0                                                      10.0
```

Now we could combine get just a window of another one of our primitive signals using this window filter.
```rust
let exp_window = exponential.zip(window).map(|(ex, x5)| ex * x5);
```

```
"exp_window": 1.0000, 0.8000, 0.6400, 0.5120, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000
⡁                                                             1.0

##  Rust math performance and cmsis-dsp-sys
For these basic uses rust is as or more performant than C. Not to mention I've found at least 3 out of bounds accesses in the C code when porting it to Rust. However for bigger algorithms a completely C or Rust approach eventually falls behind highly tuned assembly language and specialized instructions. The assembly language implementation is working through stabilization now, and intrinsics are slowly added over time, but the fact is the most performant code is going to have to be rewritten in rust or statically linked to C.

For arm microcontrollers these algorithms are all shipped from the instruction set proider Arm, in a library called CMSIS. As a result I've created [cmsis-dsp-sys](https://crates.io/crates/cmsis-dsp-sys) which provides Rust bindings for the prebuilt cmsis-dsp math library from C/assembly. static linked cmsis-dsp-sys that library over to Rust so we can stay productive while we build pure rust versions, as well as benchmark ourselves to see how were doing.

## Graphing Libraries, Terminal User Interaces, and Cargo Embed

The native graphs were generated using [textplots](https://crates.io/crates/textplots): A library for plotting graphs in terminal.

But occasionally for more resolution graphs I reach for [plotly](https://crates.io/crates/plotly): A more sophisticated plotting libary which is powered by [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) (which is built on [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)).

For on device data, I have some forks going of cargo-embed to capture remote data to .dat files for graphing. [cargo-embed](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-embed) is a general purpose tool for doing cargo builds, uploading to deivce, and receiving data back.

Better yet I'm also working on doing live graphs of on device data. cargo-embed uses [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) a library for building rich terminal user interfaces and dashboards under the hood and I have some forks of that going.


## Magic Wand TensorFlow Lite Example for the PyGamer

As an alternative to writing your own algorithms to process signals, you can train a machine learning (ML) model to come up with the relevant rules for you. TensorFlow is a library that represents computations as a dataflow graph, which is widely used in ML. There is a scaled-down port of TensorFlow, also from Google, called Tensorflow Micro Lite, which can run on constrained systems like microcontrollers. A "magic wand" is a common demonstration  which uses a model trained on the accelerometer data to infer how the device is being waved around (e.g. in a circular motion) and change the color of an LED based on the inferred motion.

As there is a [tfmicro crate](https://crates.io/crates/tfmicro) which provides no-std Rust bindings for the TFMicro library, Jacob created a [magic wand example](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/atsamd/blob/082808e3cf1ad1befe2c6aceef285dfd27328eef/boards/pygamer/examples/magic_wand.rs) for the project he works on which provides a board support crate for the [AdaFruit PyGamer board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242).

More on this in the future for sure.

# Managing Game State via [@DanielPBank](https://github.com/danielbank)

I started working on a simple game to get some practical experience working with `structs`, `impl` blocks, and the ownership model. Some interesting topics came up around making games with Rust.

## ECS

The first recommendation was that I could look at common patterns that game developers use to inform my research. [Entity–component–system (ECS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) is an architectural pattern that is mostly used in game development. There is a game engine written in Rust called [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/) which comes with an ECS crate called [specs](https://crates.io/crates/specs). Chris also shared a [RustConf keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKLntZcp27M) by [Catherine West](https://github.com/kyren) where she shares good (and bad) practices for developing game engines in general, and how Rust helps guide you to those patterns.

As always, a good resource for any topic in Rust is the `Are We ____` site, in this case: https://www.arewegameyet.rs/
