Jacob Rosenthal brings you on a journey through options and results and when to use each, and to combine and chain them.

### Options and Results via [@jacobRosenthal](https://github.com/jacobRosenthal)

[Ok and Err](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html) and [Some and None](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/index.html)
Generally dont unwrap() or expect(). Rust is trying to help you write programs that don't exit randomly while running afterall!

#### return it

One option is to make it someone elses problem by just returning the result. We used to use [try! macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.try.html) Nowadays we cant use the try operator though, it has been replaced with the [?](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html)

#### deal with it yourself

Or you can deal with it yourself

-   The old school [match pattern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/match.html)

```rust
match result {
    Some(x) => println!("Result: {}", x),
    None    => println!("Cannot divide by 0"),
}
```

-   [if let destructuring](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/if_let.html) can be nicer than match sometimes

```rust
if let Some(i) = number {
    println!("Matched {:?}!", i);
}
```

-   if you dont care about the value or error just the end (little case r) result try [is_ok()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.is_ok) or [is_err()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.is_err)

```rust
if(x.is_ok() && y.is_err()){
}
```

-   you can also use [Combinators](https://learning-rust.github.io/docs/e6.combinators.html) to string a bunch of results or options together. Theres a TON of these

```rust
s1.or(s2)
s1.or_else(|| Some("some2"))
s1.and_then(|| Some("some2"))
```

#### [Iterators](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html)

Iterators are another spot you're going to deal with options and results quite a bit. iter.next() returns an option. Though [for looping](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/iterators.html) calls iter.next for you and will handle it for you. But then you end up dealing with nested results and options quite a bit too. Check out all the [Functional Combinators](http://blog.madhukaraphatak.com/functional-programming-in-rust-part-2/) you may have heard of like filters, map/reduce

### Crates you should know bluetooth edition:

-   [rumble](https://github.com/mwylde/rumble) for scanning for ble devices and connecting to them
-   [bluster](https://github.com/dfrankland/bluster) for making a ble device for other people to connect to. Has no docs, but check out this [bleboard implementation](https://github.com/dfrankland/bleboard)
