# Recognizing "Hand-Drawn" Numbers on PyGamer via [@DanielPBank](https://github.com/danielbank)

I'm working on making an example app for the PyGamer which allows the user to draw numbers and the app infers what number is drawn. I want to use a model that was trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), load it in the app, and use it to run inference. I found a crate called [tch](), which is Rust bindings for the [PyTorch C++ API](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/). There is some [example code](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/issues/50) in a GitHub Issue for saving / loading models. Now I just need to build it for an embedded system. Is it possible? I can add the `#![no_std]` pragma and it still builds. When I add the `#![no_main]` pragma, the build fails with an error:

```
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1
  |
  ...
  = note: ld: entry point (_main) undefined. for architecture x86_64
          clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

It may be possible to build this for an embedded system, but I need to inspect the source code thoroughly for things like usage of Vec or HashMap (or any kind of std::collections).

Jacob mentioned that he was working on a [tensorflow-lite-sys](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal/tensorflow-lite-sys), Rust bindings of the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers. This would support embedded systems and may be an easier avenue to go.

# Intro to Embedded via [@craig_jbishop](https://github.com/craigjb)

Craig takes us through an [Intro to Embedded Rust](https://craigjb.com/2019/12/31/stm32l0-rust/). Some highlights:

-   The various layers of the Rust embedded ecosystem: low-level cortex-m support, minimal cortex-m startup and runtime (cortex-m-rt), panic handlers, peripheral access crates (PACs), hardware access layers (HALs), peripheral and device drivers, board support crates, real time operating systems (RTOS), and finally application code.

-   The benefits of owning and using a debugger over using the bootloader mode.

-   Automating task running with a Makefile.toml and [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make)

# More Rust Embedded via [@jacobrosenthal](https://github.com/jacobrosenthal)

Jacob expands upon Craig's talk with a few more points:

-   [cortex-m-quickstart](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart/), a template for building apps for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers

-   Using [cargo-expand](https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-expand) to expand the macro code of a Hello World Rust application (the app template resulting from running `cargo new foo`). There is still a lot of underlying code that depends on std libraries, none of which will work in an embedded application.

# A Crate You Should Know via [@PhilGebhardt](https://github.com/philgebhardt)

Phil talks about [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap), a crate for doing command-line argument parsing. Jacob adds as an addendum the [structopt](https://crates.io/crates/structopt) crate, which is built on clap and uses derived macros.

# How To Write Fast Rust Code via [@likebike](https://github.com/likebike)

Christopher shows off his [extremely fast crate for evaluating algebraic expressions](https://crates.io/crates/fasteval) and explains some of the techniques he used to make it fast. He wrote [a blog post about writing fast rust code](http://likebike.com/posts/How_To_Write_Fast_Rust_Code.html) and goes through the points, such as taking noise-free measurements, profiling with `perf`, compiling with `RUSTFLAGS="--emit=asm"`, and reducing redundant computations.

# Miscellaneous

-   Some Rust buzz related to [Fuschia](https://fuchsia.dev/), Google's New OS: [Rust is approved for use throughout the Fuchsia Platform Source Tree](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/master/docs/project/policy/programming_languages.md#Rust)

-   [Gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com/), Failure as a Service. This company is using Rust. Woot!
