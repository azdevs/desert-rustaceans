# [Rust: Embedded](https://www.meetup.com/Desert-Rustaceans/events/258596537/)
Wednesday, February 27, 2019 HeatSync Labs 108 W Main Â· Mesa, AZ

Welcome back Desert Rustaceans. This month join us at HeatSync Labs for Rust and Embedded Devices.

I know there are folks in our community already making drones, stepper drivers, robots, and more so well have plenty to talk about.

Whether you're a Rust pro or just looking for a project to learn on, come show off what you've all been working on this month, on theme or otherwise.

Come [re]connect with your local Rust peers, find out that there is more Rust in the valley than you thought.

Also, join us on slack at #rust on https://azdevs.org
