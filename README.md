# [Desert Rustaceans](https://www.meetup.com/Desert-Rustaceans/) [![Join us on Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-%23rust-red.svg)](https://azwebdevs.org)

Desert Rustaceans is a local Meetup hosted by [@elbow-jason](https://github.com/elbow-jason) and [@jacobrosethal](https://github.com/jacobrosethal). We meet monthly to discuss [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), as well as our weekly [booze.rs](https://booze.rs) online/offline study groups. Come learn Rust with us!

This repo serves as a place for us to collect links and other notes from our meetings.
