# [2018 Edition Release Party](https://www.meetup.com/Desert-Rustaceans/events/256503618/)
Thursday, December 6, 2018 HeatSync Labs 108 W Main Â· Mesa, AZ

Welcome back Desert Rustaceans! Join us at the new HeatSync Labs (a few doors down from the old location) to reboot the Phoenix Rust meetup and celebrate the 2018 Edition release.

We'd like to formally invite advanced devs, newbies, and even previous defectors to join us at this informal gathering.

We'll talk about features we're excited about, what didn't make it in, how Rust is moving into new domains like Network services, CLIs, WebAssembly, and Embedded Devices, and why maybe now is the time to start or get back into Rust.

Come [re]connect with your local Rust peers, find out that there is more Rust in the valley than you thought, and shape the direction of this meetup going forward.

Also, join us on slack at #rust on https://azwebdevs.org
